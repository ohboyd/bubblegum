# Bubblegum

This is meant to showcase object interaction amongst many objects. Each individual bubble is aware of the others around it, and changes color based on contact with other objects. They also vanish as they're clicked on, and removing an object in contact with others causes the uncontacted object to revert back to its initial color.

## Purpose

Practice viewing relationships between many objects, and dynamically change behavior based on those interactions.
